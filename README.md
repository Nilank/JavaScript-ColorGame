# JavaScript-ColorGame
It is my second self learning project which I did apart my Academic projects. In this project I tried to make a game using JavaScript. The code is simple and written neatly.

I used CSS too to make the game attractive and responsive. As to make the game simple and understandable neither frameworks
nor libraries of Javascript are used.


The game inputs are not hardcoded whereas they are manipulated using Javascript using DOM.

**Game Rules**

*The game has a single player, need to guess the combination of color RGB*

*The game has 2 levels- Easy and Hard, could set by a player*

*Player will get multiple chance to guess the correct color.If the player is unable to guess it right that color block will get disappear from the screen*

*Once the player guessed the right color, the "Correct" will be displayed and background will changed to the same color guessed by the player*

While completing this project I've taken the course of Web Development Bootcamp under the Instructor **Colt**.
This project would not have been possible without his commendable lessons and good teaching skills.
